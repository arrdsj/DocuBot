This is your chance to put all the skills and knowledge you've learned throughout the bootcamp into action by creating real-world AI application.\n","\n","You have the freedom to create any application or model, be it text-based or image-based or even voice-based or multimodal.\n","\n","To get you started, here are some ideas:\n","\n","1. **Sentiment Analysis Application:** Develop an application that can determine sentiment (positive, negative, neutral) from text data like reviews or social media posts. You can use Natural Language Processing (NLP) libraries like NLTK or TextBlob, or more advanced pre-trained models from transformers library by Hugging Face, for your sentiment analysis model.\n","\n","2. **Chatbot:** Design a chatbot serving a specific purpose such as customer service for a certain industry, a personal fitness coach, or a study helper. Libraries like ChatterBot or Dialogflow can assist in designing conversational agents.\n","\n","3. **Predictive Text Application:** Develop a model that suggests the next word or sentence similar to predictive text on smartphone keyboards. You could use the transformers library by Hugging Face, which includes pre-trained models like GPT-2.\n","\n","4. **Image Classification Application:** Create a model to distinguish between different types of flowers or fruits. For this type of image classification task, pre-trained models like ResNet or VGG from PyTorch or TensorFlow can be utilized.\n","\n","5. **News Article Classifier:** Develop a text classification model that categorizes news articles into predefined categories. NLTK, SpaCy, and sklearn are valuable libraries for text pre-processing, feature extraction, and building classification models.\n","\n","6. **Recommendation System:** Create a simplified recommendation system. For instance, a book or movie recommender based on user preferences. Python's Surprise library can assist in building effective recommendation systems.\n","\n","7. **Plant Disease Detection:** Develop a model to identify diseases in plants using leaf images. This project requires a good understanding of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and image processing. PyTorch, TensorFlow, and OpenCV are all great tools to use.\n","\n","8. **Facial Expression Recognition:** Develop a model to classify human facial expressions. This involves complex feature extraction and classification algorithms. You might want to leverage deep learning libraries like TensorFlow or PyTorch, along with OpenCV for processing facial images.\n","\n","9. **Chest X-Ray Interpretation:** Develop a model to detect abnormalities in chest X-ray images. This task may require understanding of specific features in such images. Again, TensorFlow and PyTorch for deep learning, and libraries like SciKit-Image or PIL for image processing, could be of use.\n","\n","10. **Food Classification:** Develop a model to classify a variety of foods such as local Indonesian food. Pre-trained models like ResNet or VGG from PyTorch or TensorFlow can be a good starting point.\n","\n","11. **Traffic Sign Recognition:** Design a model to recognize different traffic signs. This project has real-world applicability in self-driving car technology. Once more, you might utilize PyTorch or TensorFlow for the deep learning aspect, and OpenCV for image processing tasks.\n","\n","**Submission:**\n","\n","Please upload both your model and application to Huggingface or your own Github account for submission.\n","\n","**Presentation:**\n","\n","You are required to create a presentation to showcase your project, including the following details:\n","\n","- The objective of your model.\n","- A comprehensive description of your model.\n","- The specific metrics used to measure your model's effectiveness.\n","- A brief overview of the dataset used, including its source, pre-processing steps, and any insights.\n","- An explanation of the methodology used in developing the model.\n","- A discussion on challenges faced, how they were handled, and your learnings from those.\n","- Suggestions for potential future improvements to the model.\n","- A functioning link to a demo of your model in action.\n","\n","**Grading:**\n","\n","Submissions will be manually graded, with a select few given the opportunity to present their projects in front of a panel of judges. This will provide valuable feedback, further enhancing your project and expanding your knowledge base.\n","\n","Remember, consistent practice is the key to mastering these concepts. Apply your knowledge, ask questions when in doubt, and above all, enjoy the process. Best of luck to you all!\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"id":"213a611a-c434-4894-ba35-689963ee5274","metadata":{"id":"213a611a-c434-4894-ba35-689963ee5274","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1744441521416,"user_tz":-420,"elapsed":74,"user":{"displayName":"Ratih “Ratih Dewi”","userId":"08153370628406184852"}}},"outputs":[],"source":["# @title #### Student Identity\n","student_id = \"REA6HXRRQ\" # @param {type:\"string\"}\n","name = \"Ratih Dewi Setyo Jati\" # @param {type:\"string\"}\n","drive_link = \"https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Vrjou0HK9_7a2qA6abCbjXJA6WRDqzBU?usp=sharing\"  # @param {type:\"string\"}\n","assignment_id = \"00_portfolio_project\""]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"2c97aef3-b747-49f7-99e0-4086c03e4200","metadata":{"id":"2c97aef3-b747-49f7-99e0-4086c03e4200"},"source":["## Installation and Import `rggrader` Package"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":13,"id":"36c07e23-0280-467f-b0d2-44d966253bb4","metadata":{"id":"36c07e23-0280-467f-b0d2-44d966253bb4","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1744442356527,"user_tz":-420,"elapsed":13867,"user":{"displayName":"Ratih “Ratih Dewi”","userId":"08153370628406184852"}},"outputId":"3ec3ea26-afbe-48e1-8e28-baf6e3cdf5c9"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Requirement already satisfied: rggrader in /usr/local/lib/python3.11/dist-packages (0.1.6)\n","Requirement already satisfied: requests in /usr/local/lib/python3.11/dist-packages (from rggrader) (2.32.3)\n","Requirement already satisfied: pandas in /usr/local/lib/python3.11/dist-packages (from rggrader) (2.2.3)\n","Requirement already satisfied: Pillow in /usr/local/lib/python3.11/dist-packages (from rggrader) (11.1.0)\n","Requirement already satisfied: numpy>=1.23.2 in /usr/local/lib/python3.11/dist-packages (from pandas->rggrader) (2.0.2)\n","Requirement already satisfied: python-dateutil>=2.8.2 in /usr/local/lib/python3.11/dist-packages (from pandas->rggrader) (2.8.2)\n","Requirement already satisfied: pytz>=2020.1 in /usr/local/lib/python3.11/dist-packages (from pandas->rggrader) (2025.2)\n","Requirement already satisfied: tzdata>=2022.7 in /usr/local/lib/python3.11/dist-packages (from pandas->rggrader) (2025.2)\n","Requirement already satisfied: charset-normalizer<4,>=2 in /usr/local/lib/python3.11/dist-packages (from requests->rggrader) (3.4.1)\n","Requirement already satisfied: idna<4,>=2.5 in /usr/local/lib/python3.11/dist-packages (from requests->rggrader) (3.10)\n","Requirement already satisfied: urllib3<3,>=1.21.1 in /usr/local/lib/python3.11/dist-packages (from requests->rggrader) (2.3.0)\n","Requirement already satisfied: certifi>=2017.4.17 in /usr/local/lib/python3.11/dist-packages (from requests->rggrader) (2025.1.31)\n","Requirement already satisfied: six>=1.5 in /usr/local/lib/python3.11/dist-packages (from python-dateutil>=2.8.2->pandas->rggrader) (1.17.0)\n","\u001b[2K   \u001b[90m━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\u001b[0m \u001b[32m2.5/2.5 MB\u001b[0m \u001b[31m28.0 MB/s\u001b[0m eta \u001b[36m0:00:00\u001b[0m\n","\u001b[2K   \u001b[90m━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\u001b[0m \u001b[32m50.9/50.9 kB\u001b[0m \u001b[31m2.8 MB/s\u001b[0m eta \u001b[36m0:00:00\u001b[0m\n","\u001b[?25h"]}],"source":["%pip install rggrader\n","from rggrader import submit_image\n","from rggrader import submit\n","\n","!pip install -q --upgrade \\\n","    gradio \\\n","    langchain \\\n","    langchain-google-genai \\\n","    langchain-community \\\n","    pandas \\\n","    pypdf \\\n","    pdfplumber \\\n","    faiss-cpu"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"a4af3420-ff0e-472b-8b44-7a495ddf76c3","metadata":{"id":"a4af3420-ff0e-472b-8b44-7a495ddf76c3"},"source":["## Working Space"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":22,"id":"c1fb239a-1c81-4476-9009-d87abadf9506","metadata":{"id":"c1fb239a-1c81-4476-9009-d87abadf9506","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":767},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1744445571596,"user_tz":-420,"elapsed":20938,"user":{"displayName":"Ratih “Ratih Dewi”","userId":"08153370628406184852"}},"outputId":"e1f3c5c3-1b88-4a9c-9cec-a7142f14dd3f"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Drive already mounted at /content/drive;
